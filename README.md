# List Parser

A simple Lisp-syntax list parser for Unity 3D and .net in general

This is a single file library, licensed with a permissive license (apache 2.0). I strongly encourage you to incorporate the source file in your project directly via "git submodule" or "git clone" or even downloading the file instead of consuming a dll or nuget package.

The project is structured in such a way that you could "git clone" it inside an Assets folder and it will work regardless of using .net 3.5 or 4.x, or if your unity version supports assembly definitions or not.
